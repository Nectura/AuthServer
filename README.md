# AuthServer

The AuthServer project is a demo created to demonstrate my skills as a software engineer.

The project is an authentication service that supports both Local Authentication and External Social Login Providers.

The technology used so far:
* ASP.NET Core (gRPC API)
* NET 6.0
* EntityFrameworkCore
* JWT Authentication
* MSSQL
